-When "Explore" clicked, it opens Backlink box. Should display domain here. Something like "Find Backlinks for domainname.com". Also, after the search button is clicked, "Getting Backlinks in "site name" for "domainname.com".

-On "start page" I currently have it set to redirect to http://www.expyred.com. When trying to use the site in the webbrowser, returns error that the browser is out of date and needs to be updated. Need to be able to allow users to login and register through the browser.

-Proxies Error - "Not valid file format"??? Not sure why.
Need users to be able to use private AND public proxies without having to enter the port number for public proxies.

-In "Address" and "Port" text boxes, background is black and I can't see the address or port. Typed in manually because the file format for import was incorrect. Please make the text visible. It actually seems like you can't manually type in an ip and port as well.
